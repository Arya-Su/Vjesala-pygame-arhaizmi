<h2>A simple hangman game with archaic words from Bosnia and Herzegovina </h2>

Thanks to Tech With Tim i summed up previously known basics of the Python program and created the second game in a row
in pygame.
The skeleton of this game is similar to the original, Tim's.
I didn't want the English alphabet in the game, so instead of the standard for loop that shortens the code and makes life easier, I added the list of words of the Bosnian alphabet. 
The second change is of a visual nature. I didn't want to waste time on drawing oars, so I took the original template, but I changed the color of some letters and the font. Also, it was a little more difficult to find a font that supports bosnian letters, at one point I even had a font downloaded from the internet, but I still decided on more classic fonts. 
The third change is the words, I wanted the game to be easier and that whoever opens the program  has to fight a little until he hits the words :D

During the development of this project, I enjoyed the logic of the program itself and had no difficulty in understanding the process. The mistakes I make most often, which I will have to work on, are the use of tabs in loops and spaces between formulas, characters, etc. I want my code to be as readable as possible.

I have a bug in this game. That bug is that the program does not perceive the letters LJ, NJ and DÅ½ as one character. 

Look of the game: ![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/87396317/230125216-b1e1cd7d-3364-4665-9302-59d853af254f.png)
